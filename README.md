## Day 1: Jan 12 2021

Today I had to mount Jenkins on Tomcat, to implement a CI/CD solution with GitLab. 
### Today I learned:
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> Running Jenkins on Tomcat][Jenkins]

## Day 4: Jan 15 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today the topic was: Security. I wanted to learn/practice something basic, such as OS Command Injections. I really like the way it is presented in SecureFlag.

### Today I practiced:

## Day 6: Jan 17 2021

### Today's progress: 
 Today, i could only truly checkout the Burp Suite introduction, and the Overthewire-Wargames-Bandit. Tomorrom I will continue with the ROS Robotics Part 2 Course.

### Today I learned:
* [Security -> PenTest -> Burp Suite -> Introduction][BurpSuite]

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> OverTheWire -> Wargames -> Bandit][WarGames]
Honestly, i did not truly feel it was a very productive day in terms of what I learned, but that is due to account problems in SecureFlag (which said I was locked out) and some personal chores that had to be done. Tomorrow I will be continue with the ROS Course for Robotics. 


## Day 7: Jan 18 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I remembered some ROS concepts and functions, such as launch files. 
### Today I practiced: 
* [Robotics -> ROS](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/ROS.md)

## Day 8: Jan 19 2021
### Today's progress: 
So I started to learn Docker!!!. I would like to continue with my ROS Course, but currently, due to work, Docker is a little bit of a priority, at least the very basics.  
So, I mainly followed the Docker guide, but I had some troubles with it. So, I wrote all the commands I used for the installation.

Besides, I already started creating my own image, but it is not going great...

I also continued with the ROS course in Udemy, although my progress was quite slow, due to a problem with the path for the map, necessary for the map-based navigation. The error was quite simple, which made me feel bad...

* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]

### Today I Practiced:

## Day 9: Jan 20 2021
### Today's progress: 
So, the need to learn Docker at my job has passed...  
So, for now, Docker is not my priority. I will just complete the coursera course I started related to Docker, and then I will continue with the ROS Course, practice at HackerRank, and SecureFlag. 
I really liked the use of Docker, so I will get back to it.

## Day 10: Jan 21 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today, I decided to continue practice at SecureFlag.  
The topics of today were: 
* [Security -> Python -> CSRF][SecurePython]
* [Security -> Python -> XSS][SecurePython]

Today was kind of slow, but hey, slow and steady...
Tomorrow, I plan to continue HackerRank, and if I have a little extra time, I will continue the ROS Course.

## Day 11: Jan 22 2021
### Today's progress:  
So, today at work I learned to create reports in GitLab Pipelines, and automatically send those reports via email. Unfortunately, GitLab does not support sending mails with the created reports, so, the way to do it is to create the necessary reports, and in the next job, send then using an external service, such as MailGun API. 

Besides that, I solved a daily challenge at HackerRank. Today, I treated myself to an easy challenge. Tomorrow I will be doing a medium one.

## Day 12: Jan 23 2021
### Today's progress: 
I simply continued my ROS Course. Im about to complete it. I just need to finish 4 more lessons in section 7, and then, section 8 and 9.  
After I finish this course, I plan on doing a little project, using Amazon's warehouse map, and then start with the Udemy course on Computer Vision.

## Day 13: Jan 25 2021
### Today's progress: 

HackerRank daily challenge - Medium difficulty. 
Besides, I am just about to complete my ROS course, so I am happy for that. The code will be in my repository [InterPrep](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/InterPrep).

## Day 14: Jan 27 2021
### Today´s progress: 
Daily coding challenge. I found it to be quite easy, but still, it was a great practice.  
Today I completed an Introductory level Docker course on Coursera.  
It was fairly easy, but I liked it. The topics included: 
* Creation of Dockerfile
* Creation of images
* Monitoring of running images

Even though it was an introductory level course, I enjoyed it. I really liked Docker, and containers, so once Im done with other courses, I will *git gud* on containers, and I will later learn Kubernetes and stuff. But I´ve heard that Kubernetes stopped supporting Dockers... 
Besides, I finally completed the ROS Course. I liked it, but I think there was one missing lesson: Putting it all together, and that is my favorite part in any course.

## Day 15: Jan 29 2021
### Today's progress: 
Daily coding challenge. It was a random challenge I found somewhere (i forgot... damn). It was quite easy. 
Besides that, I did a lab in SecureFlag. It was about insufficient randomnization in criptography. It was very easy, but i love that. I really like it when such vulnerabilities can be easily solved, because it shows the very little effort sometimes you need to make your site more secure. 

## Day 16: Jan 30 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today, I just did another random challenge, and one Leetcode challenge (Largest Divisible Subset). They were supossed to be easy, but for some reason, I felt they were really hard. Perhaps because im tired, but still. Tomorrow ,I will do another hackerrank challenge, aaaaand, as i just completed my ROS Course, I will start a Python for Computer Vision course. 

## Day 17: Feb 01 2021
### Today's progress: 
Daily HackerRank challenge. Today, it was a "medium" challenge. I managed to solve it, but it only passed 5/14 tests due to the time limit. It was, to be fair, very inneficient.  
Afterwards, I looked for a more efficient solution, and wow, it was much better. Important thing is, I learned today. 
Besides that, I started my Computer Vision for Python course. 
I only did the setup though, as my old laptop had some problems with it.

## Day 18: Feb 02 2021
### Today's progress: 
Daily HackerRank challenge. Today, it was an easy one. I think it was in the wrong cathegory, as the solution for it was not exactly the expected one. 
Besides that, I solved the Weak Cipher Mode lab in SecureFlag.  
Honestly, i think there was a mistake there. To solve it, it asks you to use an IV, but according to the documentation, it is not mandatory to use one in the arguments, as if you dont, it will automatically assign a random IV for you. But meh, in cant always be perfect.

## Day 19: Feb 03 2021
### Today's progress: 

Daily HackerRank chalenge. It was an easy one. It was, well, easy, but the process to solve it was interesting. Honestly, it took much longer than expected, due to me wanting to solve it in less than O(n log n), which, apparently, is possible, but the O(n) solution is highly unstable, cause in most cases, it is O(n), but in the worst cases, it can become > O(n^2), but the O(n log n) is always the same. 

Besides that, I continued the Python for CV course. Today, it was just the introduction to Numpy.

## Day 20: Feb 04 2021
### Today's progress:
HackerRanks daily challenge: medium difficulty. It was an easy challenge, so I think it should not be on medium difficulty. 
SecureFlag labs: SQL Injection and Server-Side Template Injection.

## Day 21: Feb 08 2021
### Today's progress: 

So, I did not study on Friday because i had some german homework.  
Also, i did not study on saturday and sunday because... i wanted a rest. I simply played all weekend. 
But now, it is time to get back on with my studies. And what a bad day to restart!  
Today i got the results for a scholarship i applied to 2 months ago. And, nope. So, no master's degree for a while!
I will keep on studying for now by my own. I will apply again next year, but for another program. 

Back on topic, today I continued with my Python CV course. And, i decided to change study strategy. Instead of taking one day for this, one day for that, this time i will try one week for this, one week for that. I hope advances will be faster this way. 

In the python course, i completed Section 2: NumPy and Image Basics. Liking it so far. 

## Day 22: Feb 09 2021
### Today's progress: 

So, today was kind of a weird day at work. I work from home right now (you know, the pandemic) and the electricity went off!!!
I had to go get a place with electricity, internet (secure) and being at least in a not-too-crowded place. Kind of, tiring. 
But ok.
In learning, I continued my Python for CV course. Im in the third section, using OpenCV.  
Liking it so far. 

## Day 22: Feb 10 2021
### Today's progress: 

I simply continued with my Python for OpenCV course. Today, it was all about drawing on images using OpenCV. It was slow, but it is neccesary.  
That is all for today...
