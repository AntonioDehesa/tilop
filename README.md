## Day 1: Jan 12 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Day 1. Today I had my first contact with Jenkins, and I read something about Map-Based Navigation. For the Map-Based Navigation, I am currently taking the Udemy Course: ROS for Beginners II, by Anis Koubaa.
### Today I learned: 
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> First Contact][Jenkins]

### Today I practiced:
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation][Map-Based]

## Day 2: Jan 13 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today I had to mount Jenkins on Tomcat, to implement a CI/CD solution with GitLab. 
### Today I learned:
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> Running Jenkins on Tomcat][Jenkins]

## Day 4: Jan 15 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today the topic was: Security. I wanted to learn/practice something basic, such as OS Command Injections. I really like the way it is presented in SecureFlag.

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> Web Vulnerabilities -> Python -> OS Command Injection][SecurePython]

### Sources: 
* [SecureFlag][SecureFlag]

## Day 5: Jan 16 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I practiced map-making algorithms using SLAM. 
### Today I practiced:
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation][Map-Based]


## Day 6: Jan 17 2021

### Today's progress: 
 Today, i could only truly checkout the Burp Suite introduction, and the Overthewire-Wargames-Bandit. Tomorrom I will continue with the ROS Robotics Part 2 Course.

### Today I learned:
* [Security -> PenTest -> Burp Suite -> Introduction][BurpSuite]

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> OverTheWire -> Wargames -> Bandit][WarGames]
Honestly, i did not truly feel it was a very productive day in terms of what I learned, but that is due to account problems in SecureFlag (which said I was locked out) and some personal chores that had to be done. Tomorrow I will be continue with the ROS Course for Robotics. 


## Day 7: Jan 18 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I remembered some ROS concepts and functions, such as launch files. 
### Today I practiced: 
* [Robotics -> ROS](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/ROS.md)

## Day 8: Jan 19 2021
### Today's progress: 
So I started to learn Docker!!!. I would like to continue with my ROS Course, but currently, due to work, Docker is a little bit of a priority, at least the very basics.  
So, I mainly followed the Docker guide, but I had some troubles with it. So, I wrote all the commands I used for the installation.

Besides, I already started creating my own image, but it is not going great...

I also continued with the ROS course in Udemy, although my progress was quite slow, due to a problem with the path for the map, necessary for the map-based navigation. The error was quite simple, which made me feel bad...

### Today I Learned: 
* [Containers -> Docker -> Installation][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> First Launch][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]

### Today I Practiced: 
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/Map-Based%20Navigation.md)

## Day 9: Jan 20 2021
### Today's progress: 
So, the need to learn Docker at my job has passed...  
So, for now, Docker is not my priority. I will just complete the coursera course I started related to Docker, and then I will continue with the ROS Course, practice at HackerRank, and SecureFlag. 
I really liked the use of Docker, so I will get back to it.

### Today I Practiced: 
* [Containers -> Docker -> Installation][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> First Launch][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]


## Day 10: Jan 21 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today, I decided to continue practice at SecureFlag.  
The topics of today were: 
* [Security -> Python -> CSRF][SecurePython]
* [Security -> Python -> XSS][SecurePython]

Today was kind of slow, but hey, slow and steady...
Tomorrow, I plan to continue HackerRank, and if I have a little extra time, I will continue the ROS Course.

## Day 11: Jan 22 2021
### Today's progress:  
So, today at work I learned to create reports in GitLab Pipelines, and automatically send those reports via email. Unfortunately, GitLab does not support sending mails with the created reports, so, the way to do it is to create the necessary reports, and in the next job, send then using an external service, such as MailGun API. 

Besides that, I solved a daily challenge at HackerRank. Today, I treated myself to an easy challenge. Tomorrow I will be doing a medium one.

## Day 12: Jan 23 2021
### Today's progress: 
I simply continued my ROS Course. Im about to complete it. I just need to finish 4 more lessons in section 7, and then, section 8 and 9.  
After I finish this course, I plan on doing a little project, using Amazon's warehouse map, and then start with the Udemy course on Computer Vision.
