### Today's progress: 
 Today, i could only truly checkout the Burp Suite introduction, and the Overthewire-Wargames-Bandit. Tomorrom I will continue with the ROS Robotics Part 2 Course.

### Today I learned:
* [Security -> PenTest -> Burp Suite -> Introduction][BurpSuite]

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> OverTheWire -> Wargames -> Bandit][WarGames]
Honestly, i did not truly feel it was a very productive day in terms of what I learned, but that is due to account problems in SecureFlag (which said I was locked out) and some personal chores that had to be done. Tomorrow I will be continue with the ROS Course for Robotics. 


## Day 7: Jan 18 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I remembered some ROS concepts and functions, such as launch files.

### Sources:
* [ROS Course Part 2 by Anis Koubba][ROS Course Part 2]


## Day 8: Jan 19 2021
### Today's progress: 
So I started to learn Docker!!!. I would like to continue with my ROS Course, but currently, due to work, Docker is a little bit of a priority, at least the very basics.  
So, I mainly followed the Docker guide, but I had some troubles with it. So, I wrote all the commands I used for the installation.

Besides, I already started creating my own image, but it is not going great...

I also continued with the ROS course in Udemy, although my progress was quite slow, due to a problem with the path for the map, necessary for the map-based navigation. The error was quite simple, which made me feel bad...

### Sources: 
* [Docker: Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Today I Learned: 
* [Containers -> Docker -> Installation][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> First Launch][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]

### Today I Practiced: 
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/Map-Based%20Navigation.md)

## Day 9: Jan 20 2021
### Today's progress: 
So, the need to learn Docker at my job has passed...  
So, for now, Docker is not my priority. I will just complete the coursera course I started related to Docker, and then I will continue with the ROS Course, practice at HackerRank, and SecureFlag. 
I really liked the use of Docker, so I will get back to it.

## Day 10: Jan 21 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today, I decided to continue practice at SecureFlag.  
The topics of today were: 
* [Security -> Python -> CSRF][SecurePython]
* [Security -> Python -> XSS][SecurePython]

Today was kind of slow, but hey, slow and steady...
Tomorrow, I plan to continue HackerRank, and if I have a little extra time, I will continue the ROS Course. 
### Sources:

* [SecureFlag][SecureFlag]

## Day 11: Jan 22 2021
### Today's progress:  
So, today at work I learned to create reports in GitLab Pipelines, and automatically send those reports via email. Unfortunately, GitLab does not support sending mails with the created reports, so, the way to do it is to create the necessary reports, and in the next job, send then using an external service, such as MailGun API. 

Besides that, I solved a daily challenge at HackerRank. Today, I treated myself to an easy challenge. Tomorrow I will be doing a medium one.

## Day 12: Jan 23 2021
### Today's progress: 
I simply continued my ROS Course. Im about to complete it. I just need to finish 4 more lessons in section 7, and then, section 8 and 9.  
After I finish this course, I plan on doing a little project, using Amazon's warehouse map, and then start with the Udemy course on Computer Vision.

## Day 13: Jan 25 2021
### Today's progress: 

HackerRank daily challenge - Medium difficulty. 
Besides, I am just about to complete my ROS course, so I am happy for that. The code will be in my repository [InterPrep](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/InterPrep).

## Day 14: Jan 27 2021
### Today´s progress: 
Daily coding challenge. I found it to be quite easy, but still, it was a great practice.  
Today I completed an Introductory level Docker course on Coursera.  
It was fairly easy, but I liked it. The topics included: 
* Creation of Dockerfile
* Creation of images
* Monitoring of running images

Even though it was an introductory level course, I enjoyed it. I really liked Docker, and containers, so once Im done with other courses, I will *git gud* on containers, and I will later learn Kubernetes and stuff. But I´ve heard that Kubernetes stopped supporting Dockers... 
Besides, I finally completed the ROS Course. I liked it, but I think there was one missing lesson: Putting it all together, and that is my favorite part in any course.  
### Sources: 
* [ROS Course][ROS Course Part 2]

## Day 15: Jan 29 2021
### Today's progress: 
Daily coding challenge. It was a random challenge I found somewhere (i forgot... damn). It was quite easy. 
Besides that, I did a lab in SecureFlag. It was about insufficient randomnization in criptography. It was very easy, but i love that. I really like it when such vulnerabilities can be easily solved, because it shows the very little effort sometimes you need to make your site more secure. 

## Day 16: Jan 30 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today, I just did another random challenge, and one Leetcode challenge (Largest Divisible Subset). They were supossed to be easy, but for some reason, I felt they were really hard. Perhaps because im tired, but still. Tomorrow ,I will do another hackerrank challenge, aaaaand, as i just completed my ROS Course, I will start a Python for Computer Vision course. 

## Day 17: Feb 01 2021
### Today's progress: 
Daily HackerRank challenge. Today, it was a "medium" challenge. I managed to solve it, but it only passed 5/14 tests due to the time limit. It was, to be fair, very inneficient.  
Afterwards, I looked for a more efficient solution, and wow, it was much better. Important thing is, I learned today. 
Besides that, I started my Computer Vision for Python course. 
I only did the setup though, as my old laptop had some problems with it.

## Day 18: Feb 02 2021
### Today's progress: 
Daily HackerRank challenge. Today, it was an easy one. I think it was in the wrong cathegory, as the solution for it was not exactly the expected one. 
Besides that, I solved the Weak Cipher Mode lab in SecureFlag.  
Honestly, i think there was a mistake there. To solve it, it asks you to use an IV, but according to the documentation, it is not mandatory to use one in the arguments, as if you dont, it will automatically assign a random IV for you. But meh, in cant always be perfect.

## Day 19: Feb 03 2021
### Today's progress: 

Daily HackerRank chalenge. It was an easy one. It was, well, easy, but the process to solve it was interesting. Honestly, it took much longer than expected, due to me wanting to solve it in less than O(n log n), which, apparently, is possible, but the O(n) solution is highly unstable, cause in most cases, it is O(n), but in the worst cases, it can become > O(n^2), but the O(n log n) is always the same. 

Besides that, I continued the Python for CV course. Today, it was just the introduction to Numpy.

## Day 20: Feb 04 2021
### Today's progress:
HackerRanks daily challenge: medium difficulty. It was an easy challenge, so I think it should not be on medium difficulty. 
SecureFlag labs: SQL Injection and Server-Side Template Injection.

## Day 21: Feb 08 2021
### Today's progress: 

So, I did not study on Friday because i had some german homework.  
Also, i did not study on saturday and sunday because... i wanted a rest. I simply played all weekend. 
But now, it is time to get back on with my studies. And what a bad day to restart!  
Today i got the results for a scholarship i applied to 2 months ago. And, nope. So, no master's degree for a while!
I will keep on studying for now by my own. I will apply again next year, but for another program. 

Back on topic, today I continued with my Python CV course. And, i decided to change study strategy. Instead of taking one day for this, one day for that, this time i will try one week for this, one week for that. I hope advances will be faster this way. 

In the python course, i completed Section 2: NumPy and Image Basics. Liking it so far. 

## Day 22: Feb 09 2021
### Today's progress: 

So, today was kind of a weird day at work. I work from home right now (you know, the pandemic) and the electricity went off!!!
I had to go get a place with electricity, internet (secure) and being at least in a not-too-crowded place. Kind of, tiring. 
But ok.
In learning, I continued my Python for CV course. Im in the third section, using OpenCV.  
Liking it so far. 

## Day 22: Feb 10 2021
### Today's progress: 

I simply continued with my Python for OpenCV course. Today, it was all about drawing on images using OpenCV. It was slow, but it is neccesary.  
That is all for today...

## Day 23: Feb 11 2021
### Today's progress: 

Today is my birthday!!
But, there is not much to do really. Nothing open, not many friends in town, and even if there were, there is a lockdown due to covid. 
So, I continued with my CV course. Completed section 3/9. 
But after sunday, i will leave this course on pause, because i will continue Coding Week haha, on HackerRank. Then, next week, i will continue with the secure programming training on SecureFlag. 


## Day 24: Feb 13 2021
### Today's progress: 

I could not continue my course yesterday, due to german homework. 
But, i compensated it today. Im halfway through the section 4 of the Python for CV course. 

## Day 25: Feb 15 2021
### Today's progress: 

This week, it is all about programming. I will program as much as possible, and try to complete as many challenges from hackerrank, and complete as many challenges from CTCI as possible. 
Next week, it will be all about Secure programming, and then, we go back to the Python for CV course. 

### Sources:

## Day 26: Feb 16 2021
### Today's progress: 

Started the HackerRank challenge ReverseShuffleMerge. 
Difficulty: Advanced. 
Honestly, it was not as hard as expected. I was about to solve it completely on my own, but something was not quite right...
Looking in the discussions session, i looked at a comment, saying i should try it with the string, reversed in the final step. 
Yep, it worked. 

## Day 27: Feb 17 2021
### Today's progress: 

Completed the HackerRank challenge, ReverseShuffleMerge. 
I just needed some adjusments. Tomorrow, i will put it on Java. 

## Day 28: Feb 18 2021
### Today's progress: 

Finished parsing the HackerRank challenge ReverseShuffleMerge to Java. 
Was about to start the IceCream challenge, but there are other things to do...

## Day 29: Feb 19 2021
### Today's progress: 
Ice Cream parlor challenge. I really liked this challenge. 

## Day 30: Feb 22 2021
### Today's progress: 
This week, its all about secure programming, with SecureFlag. 
Today´s challenge: PCI Compliance Violation. 
I was really easy, because all you needed to do was change the logging, from showing the cards entire PAN, to just the first four digits.

## Day 31:Feb 24 2021
### Today's progress:

I could not practice yesterday, because i had to do some homework.  
Today, i could practice XXE.  
It was an easy challenge, but i liked it. 

### Sources: 
* [SecureFlag](secureflag.owasp.org)

## Day 32:Feb 26 2021
### Today's progress:

I could not practice yesterday, because i had to do some homework.  
Today, i did some CTCI challenges. Just two. 

It was a slow day, but whatever. I will continue both on saturday, and next week i continue my CV with Python course.  
Besides, on sunday i will participate in OWASP: Call to Battle. 
Im not expecting to win, but it will be fun. 

## Day 33:Feb 27 2021
### Today's progress:

Today, i did some secureflag labs. In particular: 
* Authorization bypass in Admin functionalities
* Misconfiguration of debug policies

Besides those, i also did a CTCI challenge, the string compression one. It was an easy one, which makes sense, as it is in the easy part of the book.

### Sources: 
* [SecureFlag](secureflag.owasp.org)

## Day 34: March 1 2021
### Today's progress: 

Continuing PYthon for CV course.  
This lection was about image processing. 
Besides, i did one CTCI challenge: Rotate MAtrix. Using additional space is really easy. doing it in place, not so much. 
I liked this one, cause i used an img to see the results, which is what i have been working on.

## Day 35: March 3 2021
### Today's progress: 

Im still doing the Python for CV course. 
This section is a little long, but im almost done with it.
Today, the lessons were about: 
* Image Processing: Gradient
* Image Processing: Histogram

## Day 36: March 4 2021
### Today's progress: 

Completed the "Image Processing" section in the Python for CV course.  
And, as soon as i started the video processing section, i discovered, that the webcam does not work, so i will try again in windows.  
Trying to solve it took longer than expected, and i could not do the daily challenge.

## Day 37: March 5 2021
### Today's progress: 

Completed "Video processing" section in the Python for CV Course. 
I really liked this part of the course, because it is what i want to do after i complete this course. and the next section, is object detection. 
i am truly excited


## Day 38: March 9 2021
### Today's progress: 

Continued with the Python for CV course. Im already at the "Object detection" section. Looks really cool, but could not advance much. 
Too tired...

## Day 39: March 10 2021
### Today's progress: 

I only had time to do one quick problem. String rotation, from the CTCI. 
It was a really easy problem, at least compared to others i've done recently. 

## Day 40: March 13 2021
### Today's progress: 

Continued with the Python for CV course. Completed the edge and corner detections.

This monday, a free day, im going to try and complete the course!!!

## Day 41: March 15 2021
### Today's progress: 

Completed the Object Detection section of the Python for CV course. Started the object tracking section.  
Having a little bit of a problem trying to remember the syntax, but that is nothing a google search cant solve. 
Besides, i had a little trouble trying to differenciate the goodpointstotrack and the tracking itself. but i think i 
already got it...


## Day 42: March 16 2021
### Today's progress: 

Continued the Python for CV course. Almost finished it, so no point in going back to other activites until i finish it. 
lesson: optical flow

## Day 43: March 17 2021
### Today's progress:  

Once again, continued with the Python for CV course. this lesson was about meanshift and camshift. But at the end, the instructor  
explains that that is not the best way to track an object, so... tomorrow i will check the API lesson

## Day 44: March 18 2021
### Today's progress: 

Completed the Object Tracking section in the Python for CV Course. 
Now, i started the section for Deep Learning!!! Woooo...
I liked the video about the Object Tracking API within OpenCV. 


## Day 45: March 20 2021
### Today's progress: 
Started the Deep Learning section. 
The first videos where about Machine Learning basics, and concepts. 
During this section, i´ll be learning the use of Keras. 

## Day 46: March 24 2021
### Today's progress: 

So, due to certain circumstances,i could not really continue during these few days. 
But, today i could continue with the Python CV course. 
It is going great, im really liking the AI section. 

## Day 47: March 27 2021
### Today's progress: 

Today, i could only practice a little bit with the CTCI. 
Due to reasons, i will not continue with the Python for CV course, but i will be studying about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. 

## Day 48: March 28 2021

## Day 139: Jan 27 2022
### Today's progress: 

Continued the React module. It is interesting, but I dont like using the sandbox. its not that the sandbox is bad, but it is a pain to switch environment for every lesson.

## Day 140: Feb 01 2022
### Today's progress: 

Started the React challenge. I am liking React, but I am a little confused on how we would

## Day 146-147: Feb 11-12 2022
### Today's progress: 

Finally completed the WebDev course. I liked it. It could improve and update some lessons, as well as include some other lessons, such as combining nodejs with React. I mean, it would be a short lesson, but it would look great. 
pushing it a little too much, maybe include something about containers. 

Now, I have also started the Data Science and ML course. It really needs to be updated. 
It is using information from the 2018, and some cleaning methods no longer work.
