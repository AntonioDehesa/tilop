## Day 1: Jan 12 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Day 1. Today I had my first contact with Jenkins, and I read something about Map-Based Navigation. For the Map-Based Navigation, I am currently taking the Udemy Course: ROS for Beginners II, by Anis Koubaa.
### Today I learned: 
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> First Contact](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/DevOps/Jenkins.md)

### Today I practiced:
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/Map-Based%20Navigation.md)

## Day 2: Jan 13 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today I had to mount Jenkins on Tomcat, to implement a CI/CD solution with GitLab. 
### Today I learned:
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> Running Jenkins on Tomcat](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/DevOps/Jenkins.md)

## Day 4: Jan 15 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today the topic was: Security. I wanted to learn/practice something basic, such as OS Command Injections. I really like the way it is presented in SecureFlag.

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> Web Vulnerabilities -> Python -> OS Command Injection](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Security/Web%20Vulnerabilities/Python.md)

### Sources: 
* [SecureFlag](https://www.secureflag.com/index.html)

## Day 5: Jan 16 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I practiced map-making algorithms using SLAM. 
### Today I practiced:
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/Map-Based%20Navigation.md)


## Day 6: Jan 17 2021

### Today's progress: 
 Today, i could only truly checkout the Burp Suite introduction, and the Overthewire-Wargames-Bandit. Tomorrom I will continue with the ROS Robotics Part 2 Course.

### Today I learned:
* [Security -> Burp Suite -> Introduction](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Security/Burp%20Suite/BurpSuite.md)

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> OverTheWire -> Wargames -> Bandit](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Security/OverTheWire/Wargames/Bandit/Wargames.md)
Honestly, i did not truly feel it was a very productive day in terms of what I learned, but that is due to account problems in SecureFlag (which said I was locked out) and some personal chores that had to be done. Tomorrow I will be continue with the ROS Course for Robotics. 


## Day 7: Jan 18 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I remembered some ROS concepts and functions, such as launch files. 
### Today I practiced: 
* [Robotics -> ROS](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/ROS.md)

## Day 8: Jan 19 2021
### Today's progress: 
So I started to learn Docker!!!. I would like to continue with my ROS Course, but currently, due to work, Docker is a little bit of a priority, at least the very basics.  
So, I mainly followed the Docker guide, but I had some troubles with it. So, I wrote all the commands I used for the installation.

### Sources: 
* [Docker: Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Today I Learned: 
* [Containers -> Docker -> Installation][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> First Launch][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]
