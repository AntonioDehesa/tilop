## Day 1: Jan 12 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Day 1. Today I had my first contact with Jenkins, and I read something about Map-Based Navigation. For the Map-Based Navigation, I am currently taking the Udemy Course: ROS for Beginners II, by Anis Koubaa.
### Today I learned: 
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> First Contact][Jenkins]

### Today I practiced:
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation][Map-Based]

## Day 2: Jan 13 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today I had to mount Jenkins on Tomcat, to implement a CI/CD solution with GitLab. 
### Today I learned:
* [DevOps -> Jenkins -> Running Jenkins on Tomcat][Jenkins]

## Day 4: Jan 15 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today the topic was: Security. I wanted to learn/practice something basic, such as OS Command Injections. I really like the way it is presented in SecureFlag.

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> Web Vulnerabilities -> Python -> OS Command Injection][SecurePython]

### Sources: 
* [SecureFlag][SecureFlag]

## Day 5: Jan 16 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I practiced map-making algorithms using SLAM. 
### Today I practiced:
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation][Map-Based]


## Day 6: Jan 17 2021

### Today's progress: 
 Today, i could only truly checkout the Burp Suite introduction, and the Overthewire-Wargames-Bandit. Tomorrom I will continue with the ROS Robotics Part 2 Course.

### Today I learned:
* [Security -> PenTest -> Burp Suite -> Introduction][BurpSuite]

### Today I practiced:
* [Security -> OverTheWire -> Wargames -> Bandit][WarGames]
Honestly, i did not truly feel it was a very productive day in terms of what I learned, but that is due to account problems in SecureFlag (which said I was locked out) and some personal chores that had to be done. Tomorrow I will be continue with the ROS Course for Robotics. 


## Day 7: Jan 18 2021
### Today's progress: 
 Today I remembered some ROS concepts and functions, such as launch files. 
### Today I practiced: 
* [Robotics -> ROS](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/ROS.md)
### Sources:
* [ROS Course Part 2 by Anis Koubba][ROS Course Part 2]


## Day 8: Jan 19 2021
### Today's progress: 
So I started to learn Docker!!!. I would like to continue with my ROS Course, but currently, due to work, Docker is a little bit of a priority, at least the very basics.  
So, I mainly followed the Docker guide, but I had some troubles with it. So, I wrote all the commands I used for the installation.

Besides, I already started creating my own image, but it is not going great...

I also continued with the ROS course in Udemy, although my progress was quite slow, due to a problem with the path for the map, necessary for the map-based navigation. The error was quite simple, which made me feel bad...

* [Docker: Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

### Today I Learned: 
* [Containers -> Docker -> Installation][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> First Launch][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]

### Today I Practiced: 
* [Robotics -> Map-Based Navigation](https://github.com/AntonioDehesa/tilop/blob/main/Robotics/Map-Based%20Navigation.md)

## Day 9: Jan 20 2021
### Today's progress: 
So, the need to learn Docker at my job has passed...  
So, for now, Docker is not my priority. I will just complete the coursera course I started related to Docker, and then I will continue with the ROS Course, practice at HackerRank, and SecureFlag. 
I really liked the use of Docker, so I will get back to it.

### Today I Practiced: 
* [Containers -> Docker -> Installation][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> First Launch][Docker]
* [Containers -> Docker -> Updating an Image][Docker]


## Day 10: Jan 21 2021
### Today's progress: 
Today, I decided to continue practice at SecureFlag.  
The topics of today were: 
* [Security -> Python -> CSRF][SecurePython]
* [Security -> Python -> XSS][SecurePython]

Today was kind of slow, but hey, slow and steady...
Tomorrow, I plan to continue HackerRank, and if I have a little extra time, I will continue the ROS Course.
