## Optical flow

Pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object of camera. 
### Assumptions

* The pixel intensities of an object do not change between consecutive frames
* Neighbouring pixels have similar motion

## Edge detection 

### Canny Edge detection process 

* Apply a gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise. 
* Apply non-maximum supression to get rif of spurious response to edge detection. 
* Track edge by histeresis (supressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges)

## Corner detection 

A corner is a point whose local neighborhood stands in two dominant and different edge directions. 


## Histogram

A histogram is a visual representation of the distribution of a continuous feature. 


## Gradients

an image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image. 

## Morphological operators 

Set of kernels that can achieve a variety of effects, such as reducing noise. 
The effect is most easily seen on text data on images. 


## Blurring and smoothing 

A common operation for image processing is blurring or smoothing an image. 
Smoothing an image can help get rid of noise, or help an application focus on general details. 
It is often combined with edge detection. 
Edge detection algorithms detect too many edges when given a high resolution image without smoothing and blurring. 

## Thresholding 

Some applications only requires a binary image showing general shapes. 
Thresholding is fundamentally a very simple method of segmenting an image into different parts.
Thresholding will convert an image to consist of only two values, white of black. 

## Blending images

With opencv, it is done through the addWeighted function that uses both images and combines them. 
A simple formula is used ->
new_pixel = alfa * pixel_1 + beta * pixel_2 + gamma

## Grid Detection
Helps with the tracking of an object, if said object has a recognizable pattern. 
This is useful, because often cameras can create a distortino in an image, such as radial or tangential distortion. 

Grids are also used to calibrate cameras and track motion. 


## Boosting tracker

* Based off AdaBoost algorith (the same as the HAAR Cascade)
* Evaluation occurs across multiple frames

### Pros
* Very well known and studied algorithm

### Cons
* Doesnt know when tracking has failed
* There are better techniques

## MIL (Multiple Instance Learning) tracker
* Similar to boosting, but considers a neighborhood of points around the current location to create multiple instances. 
### Pros
* Good performance, and doesnt drift as much as Boosting
### Cons
* Failure to track an object may not be reported back
* Cant recover from full obstruction

## KCF Tracker
* Kernelized Correlation Filters
* Exploits some propertires of the MIL Tracker and the fact that many data points will overlap, leading to more accurate and faster tracking
### Pros
* Better than MIL and Boosting
### Cons
Can not recover from full obstruction of object

## TLD Tracker
* Tracking, Learning and Detection
* Follows the object from frame to frame
* The detector localizes all appearances that have been observed so far and corrects the tracker if necessary
* The learning estimates detectorÂ´s errors and updates it to avoid these errors in the future
### Pros
* Good at tracking even with obstruction in frames
* Tracks well under large changes in scale

### Cons
* Can provide many false positives

## MedianFlow Tracker
* Tracks the object in both forward and backward directions in time, and measures the discrepancies between these two trajectories

### Pros

* Very good at reporting failed tracking
* Works well with predictable motion

### Cons

* Fails under large motion|fast moving objects
