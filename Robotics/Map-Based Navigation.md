# Map-Based Navigation: Introduction
## Localization
Helps the robot know where it is. 

## Mapping
The robot needs a map of its environment to be able to recognize where it has been moving.

## Motion or path planning
To plan a path, the target position must be well-defined to the robot, which will require an appropiate addressing scheme. 


# Building a Map: Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)

The process of building a map using a sensors such as:
* Laser Sensors
* 3D Sensors 
* Ultrasonic Sensors

## Sensor fusion: This process uses filtering techniques like Kalman filters or particle filters.
