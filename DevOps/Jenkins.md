# Jenkins

## First contact
Today was my first contact with Jenkins.  
From the very little I could see today, Jenkins is a great CI tool, which, if used appropiately, can reduce the time to build, test, and develop software. 
My first approach was I need to integrate GitLab/GitHub with Jenkins. Although I have not been able to do so, I believe I am liking Jenkins, and i will get to fully grasp it.
