# Colour Theory
The colour theory talks about having consistency in the colours we choose for delivering our message.  
For example, we would not use yellow to advertise a pool, as, well, yellow can mean soemthing in the water that is not very nice. 

## Moods of the colours 

### Red
* Love
* Energy
* Intensity

### Yellow
* Joy
* Intellect
* Attention

### Green
* Freshness
* Safety
* Growth

### Blue 
* Stability
* Trust
* Serenity

### Purple
* Royalty
* Wealth
* Femininity

## Analogous Colours
These are combinations of colours that are next to each other in the colour wheel, and they are really armonious and work really well together, but they dont
stand out too much. 

## Complementary colours
The exact opposite as analogous colours. In here, you use colours that are on the opposite side of the colour wheel.  This should not be used for text, as
it may hurt the eyes when trying to read. 

# Typography
Out of all the fonts, there are two large families: 
* Serif
* Sans-serif

## Serif
The characters have like "feet", inspired by stone writing. 
Best used when you need a font that portrays reliability, experience, seniority, authority. 

## Sans-serif
They dont have feet. They feel modern, cool, contemporary, simplicity. 

## Things to consider when choosing a font
* How open the characters are
* Ample intercharacter spacing
* Unambiguous forms (like 9 and g)
* Varying proportions (like 0 and O. you should be able to differentiate between them very easily)
* Similar mood: You want different fonts to have the same mood
* Time era: you dont want one font to look really modern, and the other font to look like from 500 years ago
* To cause contrast, you can have a difference of serif-ness and weight between two fonts

# User Interface design
## Hierarchy
The hierarchy allows us to choose the element that the user will focus on. 
We can control the hierarchy by carefully choosing the colour of the elements, the size, etc. 

## Layout
You can have, for example ,a site with only one block of elements, where every element looks the same, of different blocks, so that every block
can be used with different colours, sizes, etc. 
Even blocks of text need to have the right size. Too long, and it is boring. Too short, if fells choppy.  
The right size should be 40 to 60 characters per line. 

## Alignment
How you position the elements relative to the other elements. 
For example, having the title to be centered, and the rest of the text to be left aligned. 
You should have either both left aligned, or centered. 

## White space
or empty space. You dont have to fill every single space in the site or document with content. Sometimes, nothing is worth more than a lot. 

## Audience
Design for your audience. For example, if your audience is children, you need lots of colours, fun fonts, and other stuff. 
But if your audience is adults, you might prefer, something classy, with serious colours.
