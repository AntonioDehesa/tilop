# What is ITThanks to IT, we can communicate massive amounts of information immediately, all across the world. But what is it? 
IT, or Information Technology, is the use of digital technology, like computers and internet, to store and process data into useful information. The industry recognizes as IT to the jobs and resources related to computing technologies. 
But IT is not just about the jobs and resources, but also about the people working in it.

## What do Technical Support Specialists do
An IT support specialist makes sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. This includes managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting and configuring office and computing equipment.

## History of Computing
A computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations. 
Before we had actual computer devices, the term computer was used to refer to someone who actually did the calculation. 

Have you ever wondered why the alphabet isn't laid out in order on your keyboard? 
The keyboard layout that most of the world uses today is the qwerty layout, distinguished by the Q, W, E, R, T, and Y keys in the top row of the keyboard. 

There are many stories that claim to answer this question. Some say it was developed a slow down typist so they wouldn't jam old mechanical typewriters. 
Others claim it was meant to resolve problem for telegraph operators. One thing is for sure, the keyboard layout that millions of people use today isn't the most effective one. 
Different keyboard layouts have even been created to try and make typing more efficient. 
Now that we're starting to live in a mobile-centric world with our smartphones, the landscape for keyboards may change completely. 
My typing fingers are crossed. In the technology industry, having a little context can go a long way to making sense of the concepts you'll encounter. 

## History of the computer
* First, data storage started with punch cards
* Afterwards, we moved on to magnetic tape


## Character encoding 
It is used to assign binary values to characters, so humans can read them. 
Almost like a dictionary. 
The oldest encoding standard is ASCII. 
The first ASCII character is a, represented as 01100001 in binary. It was good, but eventually, we needed more. 
Today, we use UTF 8. It even allows us to represent emojis. 

## Abstraction 

When using our computers, we don’t interact with it using ones and zeros. We don’t send 1 and 0 through our mouse, and we don’t send the specific ones and zeros with our keyboard to represent characters. 
We just use them, and they do it for us. This is called abstraction. 
It hides complexity by providing a common interface. 


## Computer architecture overview 

The four main layers of a computer are: hardware, software, operating system, and the users. 


# The Modern Computer

## Ports 
Connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer. 

## CPU

The brain of the computer. It does all the calculations and data processing. 

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

Stores data temporarily

## Hard Drive

Holds all the data. 

## Programs

Basic instructions that tell the computer what to do. 


## External Data Bus

Row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer.
