# API
**Application Programmable Interface**
Programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request-response message system exposed via HTTP based server. 
## How do they help
APIs work as some kind of *middle-man*, allowing different applications to interact with each other. For example, if you wanted to create an app that shows something on the map, you would not create your own map system, and launch satellites, and cars to take photos, and whatever. You would most likely use the Google Maps API. This way, you dont have to know how these maps are created or how they work, you just need to know how to interpret the information it gives you back.
